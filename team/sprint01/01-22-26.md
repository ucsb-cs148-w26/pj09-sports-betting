## Scribed Discussion:

Our team conducted a sprint planning meeting and decided on the scope of the sprint and user stories to focus on. The primary goal of this sprint is 
to deliver an MVP were users are able to view all live NBA games on one dashboard and see the current win probability.

The two target user stories are:
- As a user, I want to see all live NBA games in a single dashboard so I can quickly see which games are happening
- As a user, I want to view current win probabilities for each live game from the dashboard so I can see which team is favored.

As a team we decided to break the work up into frontend and backend issues along with assigning half of our team to each type of issue. We also confrimed that
individual player props and advanced data visualization was outside the scope of the first sprint and MVP, thus wil remain on the backlog. There are a few
infrastrucutre issues that will also be handled as well that are not directly attached to a user story.
