## Action item

* a goal: Communicate more often and effectively 
* a change/experiment: Using iMessage to contact each other more frequently and effectively. 
* a measurement: Timeline of progressing Kanban issues

## Retro Assessment

* We used the stop, continue, stop strategy for our first retrospective. 
* It went smoothly as it pointed out the majority fault that we needed to work on most as a team. 
* To be able to communicate with all team members by reaching out for their inputs for start, stop, and continue.

## Experiment/Change

* We decided to encourage the team members to use our text message group chat more for tasks such as PRs, general questions on how we want to implement features, and more. The reason we did this was that most of us had never worked together before, and all of us had good experiences working with group mates with good communication.
* This experiment had very good results for our team. We would see the issues on the kanban board move from the 'In Review' column to the 'Done' column much faster than before.
* We are going to keep this change as it has yielded great results for how organized our team is.
