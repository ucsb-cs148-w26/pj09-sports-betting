# Response
- We plan to have more interactive elements like walkthroughs on how to use the app and graphs in the next release
- Although the UI is simple and easy to use, we will make it more aesthetically pleasing and options for dark mode
- There are no plans to add more sports in the near future as this outside of the time scope of this class
- There are also no plans to create a feature for direct betting for the forseeable future
- We have no plans to implement user accounts since the website is supposed to be quick and easy to search up. There isn't a need for personalization.
# Next Steps

For our next steps, we plan to add a disclaimer that pops up that directs users to gambling help hotline in case they have a gambling addiction. We want to reinforce the idea that this website's primary goal is not to endorse unhealthy gambling habits. We also plan on having a more polished UI, as the UI right now is blocky HTML and very basic (akin to an illegal streaming website as someone stated). Our next phase of this project also includes adding graphical representations of win probabilities, so we plan on finalizing database schemas and initializing data flow with PostgreSQL to display it.
