# Next Steps

For our next steps, we plan to add a disclaimer that pops up that directs users to gambling help hotline in case they have a gambling addiction. We want to reinforce the idea that this website's primary goal is not to endorse unhealthy gambling habits. We also plan on having a more polished UI, as the UI right now is just basically blocky HTML and very basic (akin to an illegal streaming website as someone stated). Our next phase of this project also includes adding graphical representations of win probabilities, so we plan on finalizing database schemas and initializing data flow with PostgreSQL to display it.
