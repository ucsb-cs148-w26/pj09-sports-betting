My name is Alvin, a current 3rd Year CS and DS student at UCSB. I am definitely more of a casual sports fan compared to a lot of people I know. Despite this, basketball is the sport I know the most about and I am excited to develop a prediction app since sports betting is a hot topic nowadays. A feature I would want to make sure we implement is a way to scrape data for each of the players and match them to specific bet lines on sites like PrizePicks to create probabilities for the bet lines.
