Hello, my name is Logan and I am a 3rd year CS student at UCSB. I love basketball and have played almost all my life. I keep up to date with the NBA and am excited to work on an app that tracks live probabilites for the game. One idea that I have for the project is to be able to gather as much play by play data for games in previous season to train a model to be able to give play by play probabilites for live games.
