Hello my name is Junhyung Yoon and I am a 3rd year computer science major at UCSB. I am originally from Irvine, CA and grew up there my whole life. Some of my interests include swimming, playing guitar, basketball, and video games. For the project I envision a real-time probability app that is able to give a probability for how likely a team is to winning a game. Specifically, we would be focuisng on nba games and be using the real-time score, player statuses, and other data that could be useful in order to power an LLM to output said probability.
