For my AI coding experiment, I tried to create an entire mobile app strictly using the Gemini 3.0 Pro model. The main function of my app for the experiment was to have an easy way for users to keep track of clothes in their wardrobe and have a way for them to pit it up for sale. I first prompted the bot to give me an effective prompt format for it to generate code and then filled out the blanks in the format it gave me. The first few iterations of the app contained the main function of having a virtual "closet," but it didn't allow images of the clothes to be uploaded/searched online, which I think is important. I think this shows the importance on being very clear with my words when prompting something. I believe Gemini Pro 3.0 will be very useful for coding my projects as it produces working code relatively quickly and is able to understand what it's prompted to do well. To ensure the AI output was correct, I made sure to run through all the code and ensure it is written with correct logic and syntax. I also had to check the functionalities of the app with unit tests.
