Bob, a 43-year-old American male and diehard sports bettor who hasn’t hit a parlay in over three months, decides one day to use this app to see the probabilities of each player hitting their given props instead of relying on a vague gut feeling. This way, he can decide which bets to take based on a calculated, probabilistic approach.

Joe, a busy fan, needs a quick way to keep up to date with NBA games, decides to use this app to view all games’ win probability on one page. He also sees that his favorite team is losing, and is curious about the chances his team could make a comeback, given the current situation.

Problems:

- No convenient way to view live betting odds + game win probabilities for all games on a given day
- Current ESPN UI forces user to click between different URLs to view probabilities instead of all displayed on same page, + no live betting odds on same platform
- Curious about whether a player will hit their O/U lines or wants to decide if they should cash out early on a bet
- There is no readily available probability for a player hitting a certain stat
